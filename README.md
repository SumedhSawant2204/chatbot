# E-commerce FAQ Chatbot

This project implements an **E-commerce FAQ Chatbot** using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. The chatbot interacts with users, answering product-related questions and providing links to purchase products from online stores (e.g., Amazon). The backend uses a local SQLite database to store product information and a JSON dataset (`Ecommerce_FAQ_Chatbot_dataset.json`) to provide responses to user queries.

## Features
- **Product Search**: Users can search for products by name or description.
- **FAQ-Based Responses**: The chatbot responds to user queries based on an FAQ dataset containing common questions and answers related to products.
- **Online Purchase Links**: The chatbot provides URLs to product listings on online stores (e.g., Amazon).
- **Chat Interface**: A user-friendly, modern chat interface with a fixed chat window and scrollable chat logs.
- **Database Integration**: A local SQLite database is used to store and query product information.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Flask, Python
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: SQLite
- **APIs**: Kaggle dataset for FAQ-based responses
